# Rusty-Password
A strong password generator written in Rust.

This is a small project to learn Rust and how to use GTK bindings.  This can run as a command line tool, or as a GUI.  

In CLI mode:

```
Options:
  -l, --length <LENGTH>  length of password to create [default: 15]
  -s, --simple           simplify possible characters
  -g, --gui              Enable GUI
  -h, --help             Print help
  -V, --version          Print version
```

TODO:
- [ ] Increase the font size of the password
- [ ] Add button to generate a new password
- [ ] Auto-add the generated password to the clipboard
